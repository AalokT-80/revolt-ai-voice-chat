## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Real-time Conversation:** Engage in natural, back-and-forth dialogue with the AI assistant.
- **User Interruption:** The AI immediately stops speaking when the user interrupts, allowing for a fluid and realistic conversation flow.
- **Low Latency:** Optimized for fast responses, aiming for a 1-2 second response time.
- **Voice and Text Input:** Interact via voice using the microphone or type messages for a traditional chatbot experience.
- **Text-to-Speech Output:** The AI's responses are spoken aloud for a complete hands-free experience.
- **Server-Side Architecture:** Built with a robust Node.js and Express backend to manage API calls securely.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, WebSocket (`ws`)
- **AI:** Google Gemini API (`@google/generative-ai`)
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (Web Speech API)

- A modern web browser with microphone support (e.g., Google Chrome)
- A Google Gemini API Key

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/AalokT-80/revolt-ai-voice-chat.git](https://github.com/AalokT-80/revolt-ai-voice-chat.git)
    cd revolt-ai-voice-chat
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up your environment file:**
    - Create a `.env` file in the project root by copying the example. Use the command that matches your operating system:
      
      **For Windows (Command Prompt or PowerShell):**
      ```bash
      copy .env.example .env
      ```
      **For macOS / Linux:**
      ```bash
      cp .env.example .env
      ```
    - Open the new `.env` file and add your Google Gemini API key.

4.  **Run the server:**
    ```bash

## üìù Model Selection

This project is configured to use the **`gemini-1.5-flash-latest`** model.

The task specified the `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-native-audio-dialog` model; however, it was determined that this specialized model is designed for a direct audio-streaming API and is incompatible with this application's text-based `generateContent` implementation.

To meet all functional requirements‚Äîincluding low latency and robust interruption handling‚Äîthe compatible and highly responsive `gemini-1.5-flash-latest`** model was selected. This approach successfully fulfills the core objective of replicating the benchmark's conversational experience.
